You acknowledge that any breach of Your obligations under this Agreement with respect to the proprietary rights or Confidential Information of Licensor will cause Licensor irreparable injury for which the remedies at law are inadequate and therefore Licensor is entitled to immediate equitable relief in any court in addition to all other remedies provided by this Agreement or available at law or in equity.</p><p></p><p>10.3Attorneys’ Fees.

If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement to be unenforceable, that provision of the Agreement will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.</p><p></p><p>10.8Controlling Law and Jurisdiction.  This Agreement and any action related thereto shall be governed, controlled, interpreted and defined by and under the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
